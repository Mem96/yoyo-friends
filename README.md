## General description

This project is the result of my journey on [Start2Impact](https://www.start2impact.it/). I'm currently practicing in **_Vue.js_**.

In the **Homepage** you can find a list of videos, listed by their name and author(s).

When you click on an element of the list, you get redirected to the **Video page**, where you can see the video and the comment section.

_The comment section is not linked to any database, therefore you can only see your own comments.
Basically, it's for very self-important people._

## Features

You will notice that the video hasn't any control allowed, except for click on the video (to resume or pause it).

I thought it would look better with customized buttons, although this might sacrifice a bit of usability. The ones featured are:

- _Play or pause_, self-explaining.
- _Mute or unmute_, to add or remove sound from the video.
- _Time management buttons_, which allow to go backward or forward in time. In particular, they can set back/forward 10 or 30 seconds.

## Problems

I'm not quite satisfied with the quality of the video player, because I wasn't able to completely remove the unuseful infos and I wish I could personalize it a bit more.

I might have left some other unresolved problems along the path, since when I first started the project, a month passed before I concluded it.

Feel free to contact me if you notice anything could work better.
